# Website Design System

This project is my solution to **Codecademy Build a Website Design System** (Improved Styling with CSS).

I haven't followed the project goals entirley. As I worked through the project it turned into a colection of fonts and colours that I quite like, to give me inspiration to use in future - not all for use on one website at the same time!

I also added a bit of Javascript to put into practice what I have recently learned. 

I used coolors.co to experiment with colour schemes. 

## Objectives

In this project, I will be building my own basic design system for a website.

On this site, I'll collect together colors, fonts, and other styles to be used in future when building other websites.

## Technologies

* HTML
* CSS
